# Django & React Starter Template

- A starter template for a simple, yet feature-rich blog website, implemented using Django to provide a RESTful API, which is consumed by the React frontend.
- The purpose of the template is two-fold: (1) to teach and show examples of how to implement a variety of standard useful features in web development (2) to build on and extend in future django projects

# Features

- This project showcases how simple it can be to implement various features in Django. These include:

  - Object-relational mapping (ORM) provided by Django's models
  - Custom Permissions for Admins and authenticated users
  - JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication for managing users logging in and out
  - Viewsets and routers to combine views and use automatic URL pattern generation
  - Automatic schemas and documentation generated using Django's native REST framework documentation
  - Search and filter queries
  - Frontend Admin area with full Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) functionality
  - Uploading images from the front end to the back end RESTful API
